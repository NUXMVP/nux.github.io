        <h1>Truth Node Commandments</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Embrace Failure as a Stepping Stone to Innovation</h2>
                <p>While society generally views failure as something to be avoided and feared, we see it as an essential part of the journey towards discovering the truth and fostering transparency. Failure provides invaluable lessons and insights, driving us to build and improve systems that truly matter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Challenge Conventional Wisdom</h2>
                <p>While society often values conformity and adherence to established norms, we believe in challenging conventional wisdom. By questioning the status quo and exploring new perspectives, we can discover the truth and foster transparency, leading to systems that truly matter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Prioritize Transparency Over Secrecy</h2>
                <p>In a world where secrecy is sometimes seen as a strategic advantage, we prioritize transparency. We believe that open communication and honesty build trust and drive the creation of resilient and efficient solutions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Value Diverse Opinions</h2>
                <p>Although society sometimes overlooks diverse viewpoints, we recognize that diversity of thought is crucial. By valuing and integrating different perspectives, we innovate with empathy and integrity, leading to more robust and inclusive systems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Celebrate Continuous Improvement</h2>
                <p>While society often rewards only final results and perfection, we celebrate continuous improvement. Every step forward, no matter how small, is a victory that contributes to long-term and meaningful progress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Encourage Risk-Taking</h2>
                <p>In many places, taking risks is seen as reckless, but we encourage calculated risk-taking. We believe that taking bold steps and experimenting is necessary for discovering groundbreaking solutions and fostering true innovation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Lead with Empathy and Integrity</h2>
                <p>While society sometimes values power and control, we believe in leading with empathy and integrity. By understanding and respecting the perspectives of others, we create a more inclusive and supportive environment that drives innovation and progress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Focus on Long-Term Impact</h2>
                <p>In a world that often prioritizes short-term gains, we focus on long-term impact. We are dedicated to creating solutions that are not only effective today but also sustainable and beneficial for future generations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Empower Individuals and Communities</h2>
                <p>While society sometimes underestimates the power of the individual, we believe in empowering people. By providing tools, resources, and support, we enable individuals and communities to contribute to and benefit from meaningful progress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Strive for Excellence, Not Perfection</h2>
                <p>Although society often equates success with perfection, we strive for excellence. We understand that perfection is unattainable and that excellence comes from dedication, continuous learning, and improvement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Ground Actions in Core Principles</h2>
                <p>While society may shift its values with trends and fads, we ground our actions in core principles. These foundational beliefs guide our decision-making and ensure that our efforts are consistently aligned with our mission to discover truth, foster transparency, and build systems that matter.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h2>Think from First Principles</h2>
                <p>While society may rely on conventional wisdom and existing frameworks, we embrace first principles thinking. By breaking down complex problems to their most basic elements and reasoning up from there, we innovate beyond traditional constraints and develop truly revolutionary solutions.</p>
